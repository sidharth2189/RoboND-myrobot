# Gazebo world
The purpose of this repository is to learn, how to build a two-wheeled robot model with the Model Editor tool in Gazebo. 
Include this model in an empty Gazebo World. And, finally write a plugin to interact with this world.

## Description

```
gazebo
```

### How to run

* How to run the program

    * Update and upgrade the Workspace
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
    * Clone the lab folder in /home/workspace/
    ```
    cd /home/workspace/
    git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-myrobot myrobot
    ```
    * Compile code
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ../
    make # You might get errors if your system is not up to date!
    ```
    * Add the library path to the Gazebo plugin path
    ```
    export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}:/home/workspace/myrobot/build
    ```
    * Run Gazebo world
    ```
    cd /home/workspace/myrobot/world/
    gazebo myworld
    ```

## Visualize output

A ```Hello World!``` message is printed in the terminal. This message interacts with the Gazebo World that includes the two-wheeled robot.
